# Reddit-Crawler
## Summary
A basic SPA that allows users to search reddit. 
Practically it serves almost no purpose since the reddit search engine works just fine. 
(And this site ultimately uses the exact same engine.) Therefore, this project is simply a way for me to practice my programming skills and try out new ideas.
## Technology
The PSA was created using React. Redux was used to for state management and handle API requests. The simple .json version of the Reddit-API was used.

## Future Features
 - Allow users to enter specific sub-reddits to limit the scope of the search.
 - Create seperate sections in the website that allows users to search for particular types of posts such as images.
 - Allow users to set the number of search results to want to have displayed on the page. I.e., let users set the number of tiles.

## Future Improvements
 - Create a way for thumbnails to always be displayed porperly.
